### KIK-LG219 Command line tools for linguists

In this course we learned the basics of working in a command line interface (CLI). In the first weeks we were introduced to the command line environment and learned how to navigate in a UNIX system as well as how to connect to a remote server. Later, we learned about corpus processing, which sure will come in handy for many language specialists. After this we were able to apply our skills in basic scripting. Finally, the contents of week six and seven taught us how to install and run programs and what version control like Git is, and why it is so powerful.  

Here I will briefly list and describe the themes and key commands introduced in each week's contents.

#### **week 1:** Setting up & essential commands

The first week was all about setting up the command line environment and learning how to make use of very basic commands like `cd`, `mkdir`, `ls`, `cat` and `less`. We got an introduction to mainly *emacs* but were encouraged to use any text editor we desired. For example, I worked with emacs for the most part of the course but eventually switched to *nano*. 

#### **week 2:** Digging deeper in the UNIX system, processes & remote servers

The first part of this week's tasks included getting a deeper insight into the previous contents of the first course week. Some key subjects were using different options for commands (`ls -F`), handling and modifying file permissions with `chmod` and finding ourselves in the system using `pwd`. We were also to learn how to compress and decompress files and directories with the commands `gzip` and `tar` in order to hand in our weekly homework.

The following part was an introduction to processes. We mainly learned theory related to the theme but also experienced how to run commands in the background for a random period of time and eventually kill a process.

Finally, the theme I personally found most interesting and useful: switching between local and remote servers.
